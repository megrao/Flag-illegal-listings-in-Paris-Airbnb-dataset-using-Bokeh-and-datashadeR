# Flag-illegal-listings-in-Paris-Airbnb-dataset-using-Bokeh-and-datashader

Paris administration slammed hosts of Airbnb listings with huge fines for exceeding the yearly limit of 120days, which happens to be the ceiling for short-term rentals. The rise in these listings has threatened both temporary and permanent residents seeking accomodation as many apartments are earmarked for Airbnb rentals, as it gives higher returns. However, this has caused a housing shortage.

In this mini-project, I am highlighting Illegal and legal revenue generated in Paris Airbnb listings and flaging the illegal listings in an interactive map. Bokeh and DataShader were used for this purpose. Also, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and several data transformations were performed as part of this project.
